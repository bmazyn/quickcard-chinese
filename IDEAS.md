# QuickCard – Idea Backlog

> Ideas are cheap. Progress is sacred.  
> Only items in **Next** are allowed to be worked on.

---

## Next (limit: 1–3)
- [ ] Practice HSK1 + HSK1b daily and note friction points
- [ ] Verify HSK1b level filtering works correctly across sessions
- [ ] Minor UI polish only if it blocks learning (not aesthetics)

---

## Learning & Gameplay (Later)

### Core Learning Flow
- 3× correct-in-a-row mastery rule per card
- Auto-resort missed cards before repeating mastered ones
- Session summary: cards learned / struggled with
- Optional “review only wrong cards” mode

### Modes
- Character-only mode (hide pinyin)
- Audio-first mode (tap → sound before meaning)
- Phrase-only practice mode

---

## Content Packs (Later)

### HSK
- HSK1b expansions (days, months, colors, places, family)
- HSK2 full vocab pack
- HSK2 phrases built only from known words

### Themed Packs
- Travel phrases
- Restaurant / food ordering
- Daily life essentials
- Numbers & dates intensive

---

## Audio & Pronunciation (Later)
- Tap-to-play pronunciation everywhere
- Auto-play audio on card advance (timing polish)
- Tone visualization experiment (icons or subtle color)
- Optional slow audio playback

---

## Progress & Data (Later)
- Track per-card stats (seen, wrong, streak)
- Local SQLite / IndexedDB for progress
- Spaced repetition logic (SQL-driven)
- Reset / archive progress per level

---

## UI / UX (Later)
- Progress bar per level
- Home icon near streak (minimal)
- Long-answer stress test & wrapping rules
- Accessibility pass (font size, contrast)

---

## Platform / Tech (Very Later)
- JSON → SQLite migration
- Cloud sync (optional)
- Mobile wrapper (Capacitor)

---

## Monetization (Very Later / Optional)
- Paid content packs
- Ad-free mode
- One-time unlocks (no subscriptions)

---

## Notes / Observations
- Old HSK1 questions had better distractors
- Short, focused cards feel best
- Less UI is better; learning comes first
- Audio added much faster than expected
